#EX) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.
one = True
two = False
a = one and two 
print(a)

#1) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.

five= True  
four = False
a = five == five  and six == six  
print(a)

4==4 and 5==5 
#2) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the or operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named b. Print the variable.

one = True 
two = False 
b = one == one or two== two 
print(b)



#3) Make one boolean variable. Put the variable after the not. Store this 
#expression in a variable named c. Print the variable.
a = True 
c = not a == a 
print(c)

#4) Make a logical expression with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

a = True 
c = not 
print(c)
