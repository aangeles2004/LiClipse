#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):

A = 9 
A = 3.45
A = “youwin”;
A = true 
A = [ 2 , 4 ,6]


#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)
vara  = 4 varA= 2

#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:
A = hi
A = bye 
print

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:
Var = 16
Lista = 10
Var = “lista”


#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:

B = [ c , dc , we]
Listvar = list[2]
print[listvar]

#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first
#character in that string:

String = “micheal” 
print(string[0])

#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:
print (string[a])


#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errors

A = 

print(sumTwoNum)
#6) Define a function that has three int parameters. If the first number is 
#equal to the second OR the third number, return true. Else, return false. Now 
#call the function.
#Print what the function returns.
def true_false(1,2,3):
if (1=2)or (1=3)
return True
else
return False
print(return)
#7) Define a function that prints your name. It should have no parameters and 
#shouldn't return anything. Now call the function.

def Audriana
 print(def):

#8) Define a function that has one string parameter. The string should be a
#color. If that string is equal to your favorite color, it prints "That's my 
#favorite color!". If it is not, it prints "That is not my favorite color. 
#Try again.". It shouldn't return anything. Now call the function.
def string_colors("blue"):
    "blue" = Favorite color
    print("Thats my favorite color!")


#9) Define a function that has one int parameter. The int should be 
#positive. If the number is not equal to zero, the function runs a loop that
#decrements the parameter by 1 and prints it each time. Now call the function.

defint_positive(100):
while(100 == 0)
print(100)
100 == 100 -1
