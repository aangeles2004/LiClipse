#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = "hey" + "bye"

print(x)


#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

y = 4 + 4 
print(y)

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

h = 4 - 1 
print(h)

#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
y = 4.5 - 4.5

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
s = 3 * 4
print(s)


#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.
h = "sup " * 5
print(h)

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

l = 12 / 3
print(l)

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
c = 4.5 / 4.5
print(c)


#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 5 % 4
print(x)


#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 4 // 4
print(x)

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 4 ** 4
print(x)

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error
