This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

x  = ( string == string)
print(v)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
y = 5 == 6
print(y)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

z = 4 > 2
print(z)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

z = 2 < 6
print(z)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

 y = 8 >= 8
 print(y)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

y = 0 <= 3
print(y)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
